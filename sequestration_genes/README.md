This repository contains the R scripts for the pipeline used to perform differential expression associated analyses with *Berghia stephanieae* and *Hermissenda opalescens* (Goodheart et al., in prep.; link will be added when available). 

# *Berghia stephanieae* Analyses

Bs_genome_DESeq2_DCvsPC.R was used to perform *Berghia stephanieae* differential expression analyses between Distal and Proximal Cerata and evaluate GO terms assocaited with each tissue type.

# *Hermissenda opalescens* and Combined Analyses

Ho_transcriptome_DESeq2_CNIvsSUB.R was used to perform *Hermissenda opalescens* differential expression analyses between Distal ("cni") and Proximal ("sub") Cerata and compare these results with outputs from the *Berghia stephanieae* analysis above.
